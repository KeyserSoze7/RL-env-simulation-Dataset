Having this global view is really important to maintain the chain of thought while doing minor rewrites at a given time. ZXLive allows the user to switch through proof steps but we can still only see one diagram at once. \n\nWe should make it easier for the user to look at multiple steps at once. One way to achieve this is to have a global proof view where we can see a thumbnail/preview of a diagram at each step. This should be part of the proof step view, which currently only shows the name of the rewrite. There should be an option to toggle diagram preview on and off. It is important that it is easy to resi"}}

The fix adds early `db.commit()` after data fetch in `admin_ui` and partials so read transactions close before rendering. Tests should use keyword args when calling `admin_ui` to avoid positional mistakes.\n\n## Motivation\n- Reduce idle-in-transaction under load\n- Lower /admin latency and timeouts\n- Prevent cascaded DB failures (PendingRollbackError)\n\n## Scope\n- `mcpgateway/admin.py`: add early `db.commit()` after queries, before template rendering (admin UI + partials)\n- `tests/unit/mcpgateway/test_admin.py`: call `admin_ui` with keyword args for correct parameter mapping\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- /admin no longer holds DB transactions ope"}}

This issue tracks future integration when network isolation is needed.\n\n## Background\n\nThe SDN module was created for the original `envs/dev` architecture which used VXLAN for VM network isolation:\n- dev: 10.10.10.0/24 (router VM 10000)\n- k8s: 10.10.20.0/24 (router VM 20000)\n\nWhen `envs/generic` replaced hardcoded environments, SDN usage was orphaned. The module is ready, just not wired up.\n\n## Module Capabilities\n\n`tofu/proxmox-sdn` provides:\n- VXLAN zone creation\n- VNet attached to zone\n- Subnet with gateway\n- SDN applier (commits config to all PVE nodes)\n\n## Integration Work\n\nWhen needed:\n- [ ] Add SDN scenario or action to iac-driver\n- [ ] Extend site-config schema for SDN c"}}
